Docker Compose AI Facial Recorgnition
=========================

This is an app for executing recorgnising human faces in live video feeds. It supports the following

- Registering Faces before learning from them and using them for live analysis later.

- Tracking times faces have been recorgnised

- Uses 3 separate ai implementations and provides the most successful matches

Why should I use this?
----------------------
- When you want to recorgnise faces on live camera feed and use that information for other purposes. ie tracking employee attendance, alerts incase of intruders in the company or gate.

ie: send sms incase a face is detected when someone appears, no need to knock on the gate or ring a bell.
